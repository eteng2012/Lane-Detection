# Lane Detection using Classical CV and YOLOPv2 Implementations

## Description

This project contains two programs that identify road lanes on a video feed to aid in autonomous vehicle driving. These programs as well as their respective output are stored in two different folders.

The first program is a Classical CV implementation of lane detection, while the second uses YOLOPv2 to detect both lanes and vehicles on the road.

The first folder, Classical-CV-Files, contains the Classical CV implementation as well as a sample and output video file for demonstration.

The second folder, Ikomia-ML-Files, contains the YOLOPv2 implementation as well as sample image and video files for demonstration. It also has a results.json file that stores the location of the detected vehicles.

## Special Requirements

Please note that for the YOLOPv2 implementation, the Ikomia API used is not compatible with MacOS and must be run on a different system (like Google Colab).
